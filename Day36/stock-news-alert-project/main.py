## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

day_before_yest = stock_data['Time Series (Daily)']['2022-05-05']
yesterday = stock_data['Time Series (Daily)']['2022-05-06']
# print(day_before_yest)
# print(yesterday)
day_before_yest_close = day_before_yest['4. close']
# print(day_before_yest_close)
yesterday_close= yesterday['4. close']
print(yesterday_close)

print(diff_price)

    for news in news_slice:
        print(f"Headline: {news['title']}")
        print(f"Description: {news['description']}")



## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.
